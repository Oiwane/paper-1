/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/platex/jsclasses/jsbook.cls:26: LaTeX Error: This file needs format `pLaTeX2e'
               but this is `LaTeX2e'.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

The current input file will not be processed further,
because it was written for some other flavor of TeX.

If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.
